The advocacy commons is a project to build a platform for sharing and collaboration between local social movement groups and national networks.

The advocacy commons is two components, one is an open source advocacy platform build on OSDI with a focus on the needs of local groups and campaigners. The second part is a commons exchange where national groups can connect with local groups with structured data exchange and collaboration.
