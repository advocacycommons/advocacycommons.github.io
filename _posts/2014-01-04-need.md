The Trump presidency presents us with a chance to build a broad coalition of groups fighting for an inclusive humane society.

Starting with the senate confirmation process we've got what will be 4 long years of a Trump administration. We need to develop stronger alliances and new forms of organizing to fight for a society of inclusion and environmental sustainability.
