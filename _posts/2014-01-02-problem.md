## The Problem
Local groups donâ€™t have either the technical ability to build advocacy tools nor the ability to reach into the membership lists of national groups. The coordination costs between local and national campaigns is high.

National groups need to protect and grow their membership lists while cultivating trusted local partners to do coordinated campaigning. This allows national groups to build lists, share outreach with local groups, activate campaigns, while protecting the fundraising and contact channel with their members by acting as a passthrough for outreach.
