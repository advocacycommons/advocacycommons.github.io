#### The Solution
Build a platform for discovery, collaboration, and safe data sharing between organizations. Take existing social practices of movement building and collaboration and give it a ‘sharing economy’ style platform for it to happen easily.

The lifeblood of organizing is the contact list. Advocacy Commons is a tool for local organizers and a platform to connect them to national networks for coordinated action.
